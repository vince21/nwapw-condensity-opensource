    <legend>About</legend>
    <p style="font-size:17px">Condensity is the project of Vincent Wilson, Toby Ueno and Spencer Chang for the <a href="http://nwapw.org/">2020 Northwest Advanced Programming Workshop</a>. Condensity is a novel extraction-based summarization algorithm that harnesses a diverse assortment of natural language processing techniques. The algorithm works by first scoring sentences by synset word frequency. Then Condensity applies other optimized factors to the summarization such as sentiment analysis, Levenshtein similarity and word2vec "synonyms." The result is an algorithm that summarizes text to a high degree of accuracy and fidelity to key ideas. You can find our MIT licensed open source code <a>here</a>.</p>

      <legend>Vincent Wilson</legend>
      <p>Vincent Wilson is a senior at Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington. He came up with this project idea for NWAPW because of his multi-disciplinary interests in both Computer Science and Journalism. As the Editor in Chief of his school newspaper, heâ€™s seen first hand how traditional news mediums can be hamstrung by lengthy articles. During the development of Condensity, Vincent worked on the summarization algorithm by implementing various NLP metrics. He also planned and implemented the architecture of the backend by using tools like Flask and Nginx and services like AWS EC2.</p>
